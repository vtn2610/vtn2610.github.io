## A PEACE OF MIND

**THE PROBLEM**

Everyone who is involved in a busy life is likely to be facing anxiety, stress, or simply downtime that results in overthinking. The solution, might sometimes be to just think less, and do more, to be more mindful of yourself and your current environment. However, as always, it is easier said than done. The brain is hard-wired to think in the negative sense, and it can be hard to shake off.

**THE MOTIVATION**

Williams students, for example, are trapped within the confines of Williamstown, and it can be hard to find escape place. With o much stress inside, it is difficult to let out; the building of stress can easily lead to depression. Computer games, phone apps are currently the most popular form of escape, yet they are not helping the students coming the terms with the reality around them. There are also multiple self-care apps, but I think they’re too general, without catering to the more specific users of self-care.

**THE SOLUTION**

Sometimes all we need is just a peace of mind.  The solution can be to create an app that (ironically) hopefully stops people from using their cellphones/computers, to be both more relaxed and focused in their own surrounding. The app can offer an extensive graph of currently stressed-inducing “activities” collected from various types of users, varying from playing sports, or doing homework, to preparing business meeting. Depending from the current location of the user and his/her purpose for using the app, the solution can vary. An athlete may be using it to improve their focus between match performances. A light sleeper may use it to improve his/her sleep at night. A student during exam period can use it to both reduce anxiety level and be more focused.

The inspiration is taken from current self-care apps, including [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com), [Calm](https://www.calm.com), [Shine](https://advice.shinetext.com).
